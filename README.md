# Hello
I'm Maruno, Otsuka Corporation. I'm studying English now, though. I'm afraid you would get good instructioins in years.   
This qlik extension allows you to show very complicate custom tables.  
You can make a sheet as below.

Small and medium-sized businesses in Japanese really love such complicated tables.
